    <book_description><![CDATA[Belief in free will touches nearly everything that human beings value. It is difficult to think about law, politics, religion, public policy, intimate relationships, morality—as well as feelings of remorse or personal achievement—without first imagining that every person is the true source of his or her thoughts and actions. And yet the facts tell us that free will is an illusion.<br /><br />In this enlightening book, Sam Harris argues that this truth about the human mind does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of social and political freedom, but it can and should change the way we think about some of the most important questions in life.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[Sam says that it only seems to me that I decided to read his book, but actually the Universe determined for this to happen. This implies that I, whatever that means for Sam, am a neglijable part of this Universe in determining others to read his book.<br /><br />Now this may well be true. Sam makes such a poor argument against free will, as this concept is understood by his readers, as he states at the same time that it’s OK for us to go on acting as we would have free will. What is he actually willing then?<br /><br />I appreciate that Sam Harris, as one of the four horsemen of atheism, is trying to set us free from the religious psychosis we still suffer from as a society. But in assessing free will, Christian theology actually did a much better job than Sam Harris did here. His friend Daniel Dennett said enough about Sam’s take on the problem of free will.<br /><br />No we don’t need to give up free will altogether in order to be more understanding, more forgiving, more humble, and less decisive, less revengeful, less proud. We actually need free will to strive towards this ideal mindset. Besides us, the Universe will not bother about it.<br /><br />But while admitting that free will is an illusion inasmuch as it’s just an idea, I think we should accept it for ourselves, each of us, individually, and reject it for all the others. This is probably what Sam was willing to tell us, but then he got hungry and his brain started chasing a rabbit, not an elephant, because he was not that hungry after all.]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[By the time of his death in 2003, Bernard Williams was one of the greatest philosophers of his generation. Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy is not only widely acknowledged to be his most important book, but also hailed a contemporary classic of moral philosophy.<br /><br />Presenting a sustained critique of moral theory from Kant onwards, Williams reorients ethical theory towards truth, truthfulness and the meaning of an individual life . He explores and reflects upon the most difficult problems in contemporary philosophy and identifies new ideas about central issues such as relativism, objectivity and the possibility of ethical knowledge.<br /><br />This edition also includes a new commentary on the text by A.W.Moore and a foreword by Jonathan Lear.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[It is quite normal to feel frustrated and sorrowful about aspects of modern capitalism, but realistic hope of change can seem either utopian or demented. In fact, the way that capitalism works is inherently open to alteration and improvement. This is because the problems of capitalism are, in their essence, not about money, law or politics, but about human psychology – the field of expertise of The School of Life. As this hugely original essay argues, the path to a better sort of capitalism starts with a clear-eyed understanding of our emotional functioning and the workings of our psyches. What follows is nothing less than a blueprint, revolutionary yet utterly practical, for a wiser and better kind of capitalism.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[From Bishop Wilberforce in the 1860s to the advocates of "creation science" today, defenders of traditional mores have condemned Darwin's theory of evolution as a threat to society's values. Darwin's defenders, like Stephen Jay Gould, have usually replied that there is no conflict between science and religion--that values and biological facts occupy separate realms. But as James Rachels points out in this thought-provoking study, Darwin himself would disagree with Gould. Darwin, who had once planned on being a clergyman, was convinced that natural selection overthrew our age-old religious beliefs.<br /> Created from Animals offers a provocative look at how Darwinian evolution undermines many tenets of traditional philosophy and religion. James Rachels begins by examining Darwin's own life and work, presenting an astonishingly vivid and compressed biography. We see Darwin's studies of the psychological links in evolution (such as emotions in dogs, and the "mental powers" of worms), and how he addressed the moral implications of his work, especially in his concern for the welfare of animals. Rachels goes on to present a lively and accessible survey of the controversies that followed in Darwin's wake, ranging from Herbert Spencer's Social Darwinism to Edward O. Wilson's sociobiology, and discusses how the work of such influential intellects as Descartes, Hume, Kant, T.H. Huxley, Henri Bergson, B.F. Skinner, and Stephen Jay Gould has contributed to--or been overthrown by--evolutionary science.<br /> Western philosophy and religion, Rachels argues, have been shaken by the implications of Darwin's work, most notably the controversial idea that humans are simply a more complex kind of animal. Rachels assesses a number of studies that suggest how closely humans are linked to other primates in behavior, and then goes on to show how this idea undercuts the work of many prominent philosophers. Kant's famous argument that suicide reduces one to the level of an animal, for instance, is meaningless if humans are, in fact, animals. Indeed, humanity's membership in the animal kingdom calls into question the classic notions of human dignity and the sacredness of human life. What we need now, Rachels contends, is a philosophy that does not discriminate between different species, one that addresses each being on an individual basis.<br /> With this sweeping survey of the arguments, the philosophers, and the deep implications surrounding Darwinism, Rachels lays the foundations for a new view of morality. Vibrantly written and provocatively argued, Created from Animals offers a new perspective on issues ranging from suicide to euthanasia to animal rights.<br />]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A philosopher as well as a poet, Shelley argues that the divine attributes of God are merely projections of human powers; life everlasting cannot be empirically demonstrated, for it runs counter to all the evidence for mortality given by the natural world, which is the only world we know. During his brief life, Shelley affronted the armies of Christendom with a single-minded purpose. As Shelley observes in his dialogue "A Refutation of Deism", there can be no middle ground between accepting revealed religion and disbelieving in the existence of a deity - another way of stating the necessity of atheism. In all, these essays provide an important statement of the poet and freethinker's enlightened views on skepticism, faith, and the corruption of organized Christianity.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Richard Dawkins, author of The God Delusion and a life-long committed Darwinist, abridges and reads this special audio version of Charles Darwin's famous book. A literally world-changing book, Darwin put forward the anti-religious and scientific idea that humans in fact evolved over millions of generations from animals, starting with fish, all the way up through the ranks to apes, then to our current form.<br /><br />Dawkin's passion for his subject and hero are clear and exciting for listeners, who, whatever their religious or scientific views, will be intrigued and captivated by this involving production of arguably one of the most important books of all time.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Volumul cuprinde doua din cele mai reprezentative lucrari in care filosoful german isi expune conceptia morala: Intemeierea metafizicii moravurilor (1785) si Critica ratiunii practice (1788). In Intemeierea metafizicii moravurilor Immanuel Kant expune principiile moralitatii, iar in Critica ratiunii practice isi construieste propriul sau sistem etic, ceea ce face ca aceasta sa fie considerata, dupa Critica ratiunii pure, a doua sa opera fundamentala. Intre cele doua lucrari este o atat de stransa legatura, incat cunoasterea numai a uneia din ele ne-ar oferi o imagine incompleta asupra conceptiei sale morale. Immanuel Kant a avansat idei etice si in alte opere ulterioare (Religia in limitele ratiunii – 1793 sau Metafizica moravurilor – 1797), dar numai in cele reunite in acest volum se ocupa de problemele teoretice ale moralitatii. Traducerea a fost facuta dupa editia germana din 1956 (Leipzig, Hrsg. Von Raymund Schimidt).]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[A citi Critica lui Kant este datoria fiecărui student filosof. Indiferent de înclinațiile filosofice pe care le-ar avea și chiar împotriva acestora, prin libertatea de a-și defini propria moralitate, rațiunea sa pură practică îl constrânge la lectura Criticii.<br /><br />„Sentimentul care provine din conștiința acestei constrângeri nu este patologic, ca un sentiment care ar fi produs de un obiect al simțurilor, ci numai practic, adică posibil printr-o determinare anterioară (obiectivă) a voinței și prin cauzalitatea rațiunii. El nu conține deci, ca supunere la o lege, cu alte cuvinte ca poruncă (ceea ce indică constrângere pentru subiectul afectat sensibil), nici o plăcere, ci conține ca atare mai curând neplăcere pentru acțiunea în sine. În schimb însă, cum această constrângere este exercitată numai prin legislația propriei rațiuni, el conține și înălțare, iar efectul subiectiv asupra sentimentului, întrucât rațiunea pură practică este singura lui cauză, nu poate fi numit, în raport cu această înălțare, numai aprobare de sine prin faptul că ne recunoaștem determinați la aceasta fără nici un interes, numai de lege, și astfel devenim conștienți de un cu totul alt interes produs subiectiv de acesta, care este pur practic și liber, pe care nu ne sfătuiește vreo înclinație să-l avem pentru o acțiune conform datoriei, ci ni-l ordonă pur și simplu rațiunea prin legea practică și îl produce cu adevărat; iar de aceea el poartă un nume cu totul particular, pe acela de respect.”]]></user_review>

                                      review: <br/>A citi Critica lui Kant este datoria fiecărui student filosof. Indiferent de înclinațiile filosofice pe care le-ar avea și chiar împotriva acestora, prin libertatea de a-și defini propria moralitate, rațiunea sa pură practică îl constrânge la lectura Criticii.<br /><br />„Sentimentul care provine din conștiința acestei constrângeri nu este patologic, ca un sentiment care ar fi produs de un obiect al simțurilor, ci numai practic, adică posibil printr-o determinare anterioară (obiectivă) a voinței și prin cauzalitatea rațiunii. El nu conține deci, ca supunere la o lege, cu alte cuvinte ca poruncă (ceea ce indică constrângere pentru subiectul afectat sensibil), nici o plăcere, ci conține ca atare mai curând neplăcere pentru acțiunea în sine. În schimb însă, cum această constrângere este exercitată numai prin legislația propriei rațiuni, el conține și înălțare, iar efectul subiectiv asupra sentimentului, întrucât rațiunea pură practică este singura lui cauză, nu poate fi numit, în raport cu această înălțare, numai aprobare de sine prin faptul că ne recunoaștem determinați la aceasta fără nici un interes, numai de lege, și astfel devenim conștienți de un cu totul alt interes produs subiectiv de acesta, care este pur practic și liber, pe care nu ne sfătuiește vreo înclinație să-l avem pentru o acțiune conform datoriei, ci ni-l ordonă pur și simplu rațiunea prin legea practică și îl produce cu adevărat; iar de aceea el poartă un nume cu totul particular, pe acela de respect.”<br/>

    <book_description><![CDATA[First published in 1946, "History of Western Philosophy" went on to become the best-selling philosophy book of the twentieth century. A dazzlingly ambitious project, it remains unchallenged to this day as the ultimate introduction to Western philosophy. Providing a sophisticated overview of the ideas that have perplexed people from time immemorial, Russell's "History of Western Philosophy" offered a cogent precis of its subject. Of course this cannot be the only reason it ended up the best selling philosophy book of the twentieth century. Russell's book was 'long on wit, intelligence and curmudgeonly scepticism', as the "New York Times" noted, and it is this, coupled with the sheer brilliance of its scholarship, that has made Russell's "History of Western Philosophy" one of the most important philosophical works of all time.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Iată o carte care - aşa cum ne avertizează şi primul editor al versiunii ei definitive, cea în limba franceză, urmată în paginile de faţă - se adresează unui număr restrîns de cititori. Unui număr restrîns, nu însă neapărat unei elite, sau unor iniţiaţi: specialişti în domeniul căreia îi aparţine. Autorului însuşi i-a fost teamă nu cumva să-i ajungă lucrarea în mîna unor oameni cărora să le dăuneze. De aceea a elaborat mai întîi varianta în limba latină a acestor Meditații metafizice, cu acest scop limpede exprimat, ca ea să fie accesibilă unui număr cît mai mic de cititori. Este procedura inversă aceleia pe care a adoptat-o cînd într-o situaţie similară a scris Discursul asupra metodei în limba franceză ("en langue vulgaire" - cum îi şi explică Părintelui Mersenne în scrisoarea din 22 februarie 1637) şi, din acest motiv, al accesibilităţii limbii, şi-a expus acolo metafizica operînd mari precauţii, comiţînd omisiuni care au amputat grav demonstraţia privitoare la existenţa lui Dumnezeu, de teamă că spiritele mai slabe vor îmbrăţişa dintru început şi cu aviditate îndoielile şi scrupulele expuse, de parcă ar fi fost împinse să facă un pas greşit, poate fatal, de la care nemaiputînd fi întoarse, ar rămîne captive în capcana acelor scepticisme, ce aveau ca adevărat scop să trezească şi nu să adoarmă minţile. Pentru spiritele de rînd, aceste scepticisme fiind o băutură prea tare.]]></book_description>

În prima parte se află diverse considerații privind științele; în cea de-a doua, principalele reguli ale metodei căutate de autor; în cea de-a treia, cîteva reguli ale moralei extrase din această metodă; în cea de-a patra, argumentele prin care este dovedită existența lui Dumnezeu și a sufletului omenesc, care sînt fundamentele metafizicii propuse; în cea de-a cincea parte se are în vedere ordinea problemelor de fizică cercetate, în special explicarea mișcărilor inimii și a altor dificultăți legate de medicină, după aceea diferența dintre sufletul nostru și cel al animalelor; iar în ultima parte, acele condiții pe care autorul le crede necesare pentru a progresa în cercetarea naturii, precum și motivele care l-au determinat să scrie.]]></book_description>

O lectură dimpreună a acestor opere ni-l relevă pe filosof ca stând totodată la originea științelor omului și a ontologiei umanului - aceasta din urmă de cel mai mare interes pentru gândirea contemporană.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[Citind seara asta, în București, la peste 30°C, următorul pasaj din scurtul tratat Despre tinereţe şi bătrâneţe, viaţă şi moarte, şi despre respiraţie, am priceput ce voia să zică Aristotel: AER CONDIȚIONAT!!<br /><br />"Însă pentru ce anume cele ce îl posedă primesc aerul şi respiră, în primul rând toate câte au plămân cu sânge, explicaţia o dă faptul că plămânul e spongios şi străbătut de vase subţiri. Dar mai ales acest organ, printre cele ce se numesc măruntaie, este cu sânge. Pe de altă parte, fireşte, toate câte au plămân cu sânge au nevoie de o grabnică răcorire, spre a face să fie mai mică forța căldurii psihice, dar şi să pătrundă peste tot, datorită abundenţei de sânge şi căldură. Pe acestea două [respiraţie şi răcire] aerul poate lesne să le aducă la împlinire; prin uşurătatea sa de la natură el aduce răcorire, strecurându-se peste tot şi repede; apa, dimpotrivă. Iar pentru ce anume respiră mai ales cele ce au plămânul sanguin, este limpede de aci: căci tocmai ceea ce e mai cald are nevoie de un plus de răcire, şi în acelaşi timp aerul se scurge uşor înspre izvorul de căldură, cel din inimă."]]></user_review>

                                      review: <br/>Citind seara asta, în București, la peste 30°C, următorul pasaj din scurtul tratat Despre tinereţe şi bătrâneţe, viaţă şi moarte, şi despre respiraţie, am priceput ce voia să zică Aristotel: AER CONDIȚIONAT!!<br /><br />"Însă pentru ce anume cele ce îl posedă primesc aerul şi respiră, în primul rând toate câte au plămân cu sânge, explicaţia o dă faptul că plămânul e spongios şi străbătut de vase subţiri. Dar mai ales acest organ, printre cele ce se numesc măruntaie, este cu sânge. Pe de altă parte, fireşte, toate câte au plămân cu sânge au nevoie de o grabnică răcorire, spre a face să fie mai mică forța căldurii psihice, dar şi să pătrundă peste tot, datorită abundenţei de sânge şi căldură. Pe acestea două [respiraţie şi răcire] aerul poate lesne să le aducă la împlinire; prin uşurătatea sa de la natură el aduce răcorire, strecurându-se peste tot şi repede; apa, dimpotrivă. Iar pentru ce anume respiră mai ales cele ce au plămânul sanguin, este limpede de aci: căci tocmai ceea ce e mai cald are nevoie de un plus de răcire, şi în acelaşi timp aerul se scurge uşor înspre izvorul de căldură, cel din inimă."<br/>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Una dintre cele mai importante scrieri autobiografice ale lui Franz Kafka este <i>Scrisoare către tata</i>, care se adaugă <i>Jurnalului 1910–1923</i> şi volumelor de corespondenţă. Paginile adresate tatălui, Hermann Kafka, sunt scrise în 1919, după ultima încercare eşuată a lui Franz de a se căsători. „Eternul fiu“, cum l-a numit unul dintre comentatori pe Franz Kafka, se războieşte o viaţă întreagă cu tatăl său. Cu toate acestea, cititorul are senzaţia că fiul luptă fără să vrea împotriva lui însuşi, doar ca să nu-l vadă pe tată, pe tatăl mitic, pierzând.<br /><br />„Literatura universală datorează tatălui unele din cele mai frumoase pagini, iar scrisoarea lui Kafka este una dintre ele. Chiar dacă, aşa cum se întâmplă adesea cu corespondenţa, ea nu conţine nici cea mai mică intenţie literară. În cazul lui Franz Kafka, literatura câştigă întotdeauna în faţa vieţii.“ (Ioana PÂRVULESCU)<br /><br />„Era oare un martir sau era doar neîndemânatic? E un scriitor genial, dar n-are încredere în ce scrie. E conştient de valoarea lui, dar de o modestie nimicitoare. Femeile îl adoră, dar se înfăşoară în iubiri nefericite, în care, în loc de bucurie, nu găseşte decât umilinţe. Apreciază viaţa, se poate spune că e un hedonist şi totuşi duce o existenţă de ascet. Singuratic din fire, vrea mereu să se însoare. Face gimnastică, grădinărie, ca să-şi întreţină sănătatea, doarme iarna cu fereastra deschisă, merge mult pe jos, înoată, dar e atins de timpuriu de o boală mortală. Destin emoţionant. Personajul Kafka, poate mai mult decât opera lui, ne va chinui tot timpul şi mă întreb dacă nu cumva aici se află adevărata lui moştenire.“ (Imre KERTESZ, laureat al Premiului Nobel pentru literatură)<br /><br />„Kafka ne scrutează viaţa cotidiană cu o minuţiozitate pe care această viaţă n-o suportă. Starea de luciditate extremă pe care o trezeşte în noi viziunea lui seamănă până la confuzie cu un coşmar.“ (Denis de ROUGEMONT)]]></book_description>

Europa modernă a fost rezultatul întâlnirii acestor spirite creative diverse. E datoria noastră să le cultivăm şi să le ţinem împreună. Sunt sigur că lectura şi reflecţia liberă asupra acestei cărţi vor reprezenta o contribuţie.”<br /><br />Valentin Mureşan]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Publicată inițial, în prima ediție în 1785, cu titlul Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten, este una dintre cele mai influente creații din întreaga operă filosofică a lui Immanuel Kant și, totodată, un reper în istoria filosofiei universale.<br />Lucrarea filosofului german cuprinde o prefață, trei secțiuni – Trecerea de la cunoaşterea raţională comună a moravurilor la aceea filosofică, Trecerea de la înţelepciunea morală populară la metafizica moravurilor, Trecerea de la metafizica moravurilor la critica raţiunii pure practice – și o remarcă finală, precedate de nota traducătorului, Valentin Mureșan.<br />În prefață, Kant pledează pentru o metafizică a moravurilor și discută despre metodologia pe care a folosit-o. El pornește de la împărțirea filosofiei grecești în fizică, etică și logică. În prima secțiune, după cum și titlul sugerează, se face trecerea de la forma cunoașterii comune privind moravurile la cea filosofică. El discută, printre altele, despre voința bună și datorie. În secțiunea a doua se aprofundează problema imperativelor. În ultima secțiune, Kant discută despre voință, libertate. De fapt, cea de-a treia secțiune reprezintă punctul de pornire de la care Kant a dezvoltat Critica rațiunii practice, publicată în 1788.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA["Citind Întemeierea metafizicii moravurilor în București" ar putea fi, la scară locală desigur, un bestseller — o selecție de memorii, precum aceea a lui Azar Nafisi din cartea sa "Citind Lolita în Teheran", dar din perioada recentă a ultimelor decenii, ce au loc în această capitală periferică europeană. Moralitatea oamenilor de aici e constituită, la fel ca doctrina morală a lui Kant, pe premisa libertății. Asemănarea între cele două moralități se oprește însă aici. Conceptele kantiene de datorie, respect, lege universală, imperativ categoric, chiar și ființă rațională, nu se regăsesc în această moralitate, să-i zicem, românească. Conceptul esențial al acestei moralități este excepția. Legea, regula, norma, devin aici niște contingențe și sunt folosite doar pentru a pune în valoare excepția. Dar asta nu mai este normativitate.<br /><br />Acu vreo două săptămâni, când am cumpărat "Întemeierea metafizicii moravurilor", vecinul de la 5 a început renovarea apartamentului. Programul de lucru, sau cum îi zice fiică-mea în vârstă de 2 ani — programul de gălăgie, coincide, între orele 13-17, cu programul de liniște așa cum este afișat deasupra intrării blocului unde locuiesc în București. În același interval orar încearcă și fiică-mea să doarmă, zilnic, acasă. Discuțiile pe care le-am avut, din pricina acestei contradicții, cu vecinul de la 5, cu agenții poliției locale la care am apelat la sugestia acestuia, cu administratorul blocului, iar apoi cu vecinul de la 6 care, urmând exemplul celui de la 5, își stabilise același program de gălăgie dar în plus își instalase masa de lucru și flexul în holul blocului, au fost pe de o parte foarte amuzante, iar pe de altă parte edificatoare pentru mine în înțelegerea doctrinei morale kantiene. Povestea asta, expusă sub formă de dialog, ar putea fi una dintre memoriile din "Citind Întemeierea metafizicii moravurilor în București".<br /><br />Cred că astfel de cărți, nu doar adresate publicului larg, ci concepute să devină bestseller-uri, ar valorifica efortul uriaș al filosofilor de a elabora teorii morale, popularizându-le și, totodată, punând la îndoială, măcar pentru cei cu înclinația (sic!) spre gândire critică, propria moralitate.]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Cu peste un mileniu şi jumătate înainte de a fi fost create poemele homerice, în Mesopotamia, «ţara dintre cele două fluvii», scribii scrijeleau pe plăci de cărămidă arsă, în ciudata lor scriere cuneiformă, cea dintâi epopee a lumii. <br />Mai veche decât Iliada şi Odiseea, mai veche decât Biblia, epopeea care cântă vitejiile şi suferinţele lui Ghilgameş, legendarul rege al Urukului, îşi datoreşte însă valoarea universală nu numai vechimii, ci mai cu seamă deosebitelor sale merite care privesc deopotrivă calitatea şi caracterul operei. Amestec de întâmplări minunate, de multe ori dramatice, cu profunde învăţături morale, el ne înfăţişează pe cel dintâi erou tragic al tuturor timpurilor. <br />Ceea ce este fundamental în mitul lui Ghilgameş se poate numi drama existenţială a omului, lupta lui cu forţele oculte şi perspectiva înfrângerii lor, raportul cu femeia şi raportul de prietenie între oameni, teama de moarte şi setea de nemurire; paralel, mitul rezumă alegoric istoria devenirii şi destinul oamenilor ca societate: vânătoarea, păstoritul, civilizaţia urbană, constituirea statului arhaic, catastrofele cosmice, marile întrebări ale gândirii.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This is the first complete translation of Otto Rank's fascinating text on the nature and history of the concept of the Soul and Will in the psychological history of humankind... a tour de force in vigour, scope and application to many contemporary issues such as sexual behaviors, the nature of dreaming, incest prohibitions and narcissism, to name but a few. (L.R. Edgar Journal of the Royal Anthropological Society ) In his last years, Otto Rank turned his lifetime of thought and learning toward two of the most difficult topics in human history: religion and the soul.<br /><br />Unlike many other intellectuals of the twentieth century, Rank maintains a place for the soul rather than dismissing it as a fantasy. The soul and the beliefs about it, he argues, set forth the foundation for psychology, with its complex analyses of consciousness, self-consciousness, and personality. Rank's commentary is not limited to beliefs about individual souls but includes ideas about group souls, sometimes encompassing nations or generations. Rank suggests that it is in expression of group beliefs that the idea of the soul attains its greatest power. What is the soul? Otto Rank treats it as a universal and essential belief for individuals and their societies, constant in function but evolving in form through millennia. To borrow a post-Rankian metaphor, the soul was created in the big bang of irresistible psychological force colliding with immutable biological fact-our will to live forever against death. The collision creates a spark in our individual and social consciousness which through history has become both consolation and inspiration: the immortal soul. All ideologies reflect this phenomenon and modify its expression to suit the era. Otto Rank wrote before the atom bomb or television, both of which alter our perception of death without changing the fact. Rank's introduction of the soul as an essential part of contemporary psychology helps explain a number of perplexing, irrational phenomena in contemporary life.]]></book_description>

Otto Rank follows this development, starting pre-religious times, as the evolution of the soul, not only from the psychological standpoint, but also with anthropological and philosophical insight, thus explaining phenomena such as sacrifice, matriarchy and patriarchy, Christian Trinity, the unconscious and psychoanalysis. The soul is a concept strongly coupled with immortality, can have an individual or collective dimension, and its understanding influenced both sexuality and the will. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to make sense of the soul and all the psychosis that surrounds this harmful idea.]]></user_review>

This book is a must read for anyone who wants to make sense of the soul and all the psychosis that surrounds this harmful idea.<br/>

    <book_description><![CDATA[„Pentru filozof, in vaile prostiei creste totusi mai multa iarba decat pe inaltimile sterpe ale intelepciunii.“<br /><br />„A te supune psihanalizei este, intr-un fel, asemanator cu a manca din pomul cunoasterii. Cunoasterea pe care o castigam astfel ne pune noi probleme etice, dar nu contribuie cu nimic la dezlegarea lor.“<br /><br />„Am putea, de asemenea, spune: ura dintre oameni provine din faptul ca ne izolam unii de altii. Deoarece nu vrem sa priveasca celalalt inauntrul nostru, caci ceea ce este acolo nu arata frumos. Trebuie, bineinteles, sa continuam a ne rusina de ceea ce este inauntrul nostru, dar nu sa ne fie rusine de aceasta in fata oamenilor.“<br /><br />Ludwig Wittgenstein]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[O exemplară scriere filozofică despre arta de a purta dispute din care să ieşim întotdeauna învingători. Un manual de retorică indispensabil, plin de echivoc, umor şi ironie.<br /><br />Stratagema I<br />Opinia adversarului trebuie extinsă peste limitele ei naturale, ea trebuie interpre tată cât se poate de general, într-un sens cât mai larg, ba chiar exagerată; opinia proprie trebuie luată, în schimb, în sensul cel mai precis, restrângând-o la limite cât se poate de strâmte: căci cu cât mai generală este o opinie, cu atât mai atacabilă este ea.<br />Stratagema a VIII-a<br />Adversarul trebuie înfuriat: căci astfel el nu mai este capabil să judece corect şi să profite de ascendentul pe care-l are, eventual, asupra noastră. Îl putem înfuria fiind pur şi simplu impertinenţi, sâcâindu-l şi fiind în chip vădit nedrepţi cu el.<br />Stratagema a XIV-a<br />O stratagemă impertinentă este să procla măm teza noastră ca fiind demonstrată - văzând că suita de întrebări puse adversarului a atras răspunsuri defavo rabile tezei -, în ciuda oricărei evidenţe, şi să tri umfăm pur şi simplu. Dacă adversarul este timid sau prostănac, iar noi înşine nu ducem lipsă de neobrăzare şi, în plus, avem şi o voce răsunătoare, atunci şansele de izbândă sunt mari.<br />Stratagema XXI<br />În cazul în care adversarul recurge la un argument superficial sau sofistic, pe care-l sesizăm de îndată, putem, desigur, să-l contracarăm arătând peni bilul şi superficialitatea argumentului; dar mai bine este să răspundem printr-un contraargument la fel de superficial şi sofistic, pentru a-l putea pune în încurcă tură. Căci nu adevărul e important, ci cine câştigă.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Fericirea, spune Russel, e o stare care se cucereşte. Şi nu în ultimul rând, credem noi, citind paginile spirituale şi pline de eleganţă ale acestei cărţi. Vom constata că un gânditor englez rămâne unul englez tocmai pentru că nu ne face nici o clipă să-i avem în minte, de pildă, pe moraliştii francezi.<br /><br />Din întâlnirea cu ceilalţi, Bertrand Russell nu trage concluzia că trebuie să ne refugiem, compensativ, în singurătate, pentru a ne rumina, cu o voluptate perversă, nefericirea şi spaimele. Să încercăm, dimpotrivă, să rămânem orientaţi către locurile marilor întâlniri cu semenii noştri. Există munca făcută cu pasiune, familia, prietenia...<br /><br />Nu e uşor să ajungi în aceste locuri. Pentru a le descoperi, trebuie mai întâi să ştim ce avem de lăsat în urmă: competiţia prostească, aroganţa plictisului şi antrenul vid, oboseala vinovată, obsesia culpei şi mania persecuţiei.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[Bertrand Russell scrie că pentru el, bucuria vieții (i.e. fericirea) se datorează în foarte mare măsură diminuării preocupării pentru el însuși.

    <book_description><![CDATA[Un adevărat fenomen editorial, <i>Supunere</i> (ianuarie 2015), noul roman al lui Michel Houellebecq, cel mai important scriitor francez actual, apare in cursul acestui an în peste 40 de țări.<br /><br />Roman pe care autorul îl include în genul PF (<i>political fiction</i>), <i>Supunere</i> a zguduit deja Occidentul. Un Occident pe care încă din 1998, prin <i>Particulele elementare</i>, Michel Houellebecq îl analizează cu scalpelul îm mână punându-i în faţă mizeria morală şi deruta politică. Antieroul lui Houellebecq, François, profesor de literatură la Sorbona, mizantrop care caută cu acelaşi entuziasm pe internet meniuri de catering şi servicii sexuale, asistă abulic la instalarea legitimă la putere a unui guvern musulman moderat. Viaţa lui nu are nimic spectaculos, iar prefacerile aduse de manevrele politice se dovedesc inexorabile. Sorbona devine universitate musulmană, iar cariera lui François depinde de o convertire, ale cărei avantaje sunt nesperate. Şi de ce nu s-ar supune, când lucrurile promit să se aranjeze atât de bine? La urma urmei, nu este civilizaţia modernă bazată pe dezideratul „căutării fericirii“? Provocator cu program, scriitorul şochează de fiecare dată prin tuşele satirice îndrăzneţe, însă întrebările subiacente aparţin unui moralist care, schiţând portretul unei Europe lipsite de ideal, constată eşecul proiectului iluminist şi întrevede sfârşitul civilizaţiei occidentale seculare.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Can virtuous behavior be explained by nature, and not by human rational choice? "It's the animal in us," we often hear when we've been bad. But why not when we're good? <i>Primates and Philosophers</i> tackles this question by exploring the biological foundations of one of humanity's most valued traits: morality.<br /><br />In this provocative book, renowned primatologist Frans de Waal argues that modern-day evolutionary biology takes far too dim a view of the natural world, emphasizing our "selfish" genes and reinforcing our habit of labeling ethical behavior as humane and the less civilized as animalistic. Seeking the origin of human morality not in evolution but in human culture, science insists that we are moral by choice, not by nature.<br /><br />Citing remarkable evidence based on his extensive research of primate behavior, de Waal attacks "Veneer Theory," which posits morality as a thin overlay on an otherwise nasty nature. He explains how we evolved from a long line of animals that care for the weak and build cooperation with reciprocal transactions. Drawing on Darwin, recent scientific advances, and his extensive research of primate behavior, de Waal demonstrates a strong continuity between human and animal behavior. He probes issues such as anthropomorphism and human responsibilities toward animals. His compelling account of how human morality evolved out of mammalian society will fascinate anyone who has ever wondered about the origins and reach of human goodness.<br /><br />Based on the Tanner Lectures de Waal delivered at Princeton University's Center for Human Values in 2004, <i>Primates and Philosophers</i> includes responses by the philosophers Peter Singer, Christine M. Korsgaard, and Philip Kitcher and the science writer Robert Wright. They press de Waal to clarify the differences between humans and other animals, yielding a lively debate that will fascinate all those who wonder about the origins and reach of human goodness.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[„Aşa ne-a fost dat: să trăim o epocă de răscruce. Fascinantă sau derutantă, în funcţie de percepţia şi gradul de adaptabilitate ale fiecărui individ. O istorie se încheie şi o alta prinde contur. Nu este sfârşitul lumii, dar e ceva ce oarecum îi seamănă: sfârşitul unei lumi. O lume apune şi se întrevăd, ca prin ceaţă, contururile nedesluşite ale unei lumi noi.“<br /><br />„S-a întâmplat la un moment dat ceva ieşit din comun. Miracolul Occidentului. Ar fi putut să nu se întâmple? Cine poate şti? S-a ivit o civilizaţie altfel decât celelalte, care a împins omenirea pe drumul unde se află astăzi.<br />Aroganţa Occidentului a fost pe măsură. În raport cu «ceilalţi», puterea lui a atins o cotă înspăimântătoare. Ne dăm seama astăzi că a fost doar o fază a istoriei. Dar a putut să pară – atât de mare ajunsese să fie distanţa – că e un dat fundamental al unei umanităţi ierarhizate.“ (Lucian BOIA)<br /><br />Se sfârşeşte o lume • Cum merge istoria • Miracolul occidental • Un Occident tot mai mic • Autodeprecierea • Dispariţii: femeia şi rasele • Viaţa de apoi sau zece ani în plus • Naţiunile şi Europa • Impasul democratic • Un deficit de utopie • „Ceilalţi" • Accelerare sau ruptură? • Amestecul • Trei scenarii europene • China, şi iar China • Încălzirea globală şi Noul Nord • Scenarii blânde, scenarii rele • Într-un fel sau altminteri <br /><br />/ Humanitas]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Altă caracteristică a filozofiei antice (perfect camuflate în „sistemele” moderne) o constituie virtutea ei terapeutică. Prefațînd o carte postumă a prietenului său, Andre-Jean Voelke, Pierre Hadot surprinde, cu o formulă memorabilă, esența paradoxală a filosofiei: „Pentru sceptici, ca și pentru Wittgenstein, filozofia nu este decît o activitate temporară care permite accesul la o stare ulterioară, non-filozofică, unde nu mai există nici un fel de probleme și unde ne putem regăsi liniștea interioară”. Filozoful (ne amintim iarăși de „mitul peșterii” din Republica) este bolnavul vindecat, care, tocmai pentru că știe exact rețeta, pricinile bolii și evoluția ei, se pune la dispoziția semenilor pentru a le da o mînă de ajutor.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[„Cititorul are aici, în românește, o scriere străveche și, prin veacuri, ilustră: <i>Banchetul</i> lui Platon. Tot ce s-a spus despre iubire de la <i>Banchet</i> mai apoi în el își află obârșia și întemeierea, cu singura excepţie a iubirii întru Crist. Pe de altă parte, dialogul este una dintre cele mai mari împliniri ale prozei lui Platon, ale scrisului în Grecia veche și ale artei literare în genere. În sfârșit, scrierea, în ciuda aparentei ei transparenţe, este în multe privinţe dificilă, atât ca idei cât și ca fond istoric al acestor idei: atât întregul gândirii lui Platon, cu tot ce a precedat-o, cât și determinările specifice ale lumii grecești clasice.“ (<b>Petru CREȚIA</b>)]]></book_description>

A narration of a summer motorcycle trip undertaken by a father and his son, the book becomes a personal and philosophical odyssey into fundamental questions of how to live. Resonant with the confusions of existence, Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance is a touching and transcendent book of life.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA["Despre frumos, Platon vorbeste adesea in dialogurile sale, fara ca in felul acesta sa fie vorba despre arta. Unuia dintre dialogurile sale, traditia i-a adaugat subtitlul peri tou kalou, Despre frumos. Este vorba de dialogul pe care Platon l-a botezat dupa numele tanarului interlocutor de aici, Phaidros. Insa pe parcursul traditiei, acest dialog a primit si alte subtitluri: peri psyches, Despre suflet; peri to erotos, Despre iubire. Rezulta de aici indeajuns de limpede incertitudinea care persista in privinta continutului acestui dialog. Despre toate cele enumerate, despre frumos, despre suflet si despre iubire - si nu doar in treacat - este vorba aici. Dar de asemenea, si chiar foarte amanuntit, despre techne - despre arta; insa de asemenea, si chiar foarte indeaproape, despre logos - despre vorbire si limba; insa de asemenea, si chiar in chip esential, despre aletheia - despre adevar; insa de asemenea, si chiar foarte apasat, despre mania - despre nebunie, despre delir, despre pierderea de sine; si in sfarsit, si in chip constant, despre ideai si despre Fiinta." (Gabriel Liiceanu)]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Publicata in 1843 sub pseudonimul Johannes de Silentio, Frica si cutremur este expresia patetica a unui dialectician al credintei crestine. Dar dialectica lui Kierkegaard, spre deosebire de cea a lui Hegel, nu descrie mersul Spiritului absolut in istorie, ci infatiseaza devenirea complexa si paradoxala a individului uman, o devenire supusa timpului, schimbarilor bruste, indoielilor si angoaselor, disperarilor si pasiunilor, pacatului, caderilor si inaltarilor – pe scurt, misterului baroc al existentei umane. O carte despre care insusi autorul marturisea ca, dupa moarte, „singura Frica si cutremur imi va asigura nemurirea. Va fi atunci citita, si mai apoi tradusa in limbi straine. Oamenii se vor cutremura, aproape, de infricosatorul patos al cartii“.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[A startling encounter on a New York subway platform leads two strangers to a run-down tenement where a life or death decision must be made.<br /><br />In that small apartment, â��Blackâ�� and â��White,â�� as the two men are known, begin a conversation that leads each back through his own history, mining the origins of two fundamentally opposing world views. White is a professor whose seemingly enviable existence of relative ease has left him nonetheless in despair. Black, an ex-con and ex-addict, is the more hopeful of the menâ��though he is just as desperate to convince White of the power of faith as White is desperate to deny it. <br /><br />Their aim is no less than this: to discover the meaning of life.<br /><br />Deft, spare, and full of artful tension, <i>The Sunset Limited</i> is a beautifully crafted, consistently thought-provoking, and deceptively intimate work by one of the most insightful writers of our time.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[<i>The Evolution of Cooperation</i> provides valuable insights into the age-old question of whether unforced cooperation is ever possible. Widely praised and much-discussed, this classic book explores how cooperation can emerge in a world of self-seeking egoists—whether superpowers, businesses, or individuals—when there is no central authority to police their actions. The problem of cooperation is central to many different fields. Robert Axelrod recounts the famous computer tournaments in which the “cooperative” program Tit for Tat recorded its stunning victories, explains its application to a broad spectrum of subjects, and suggests how readers can both apply cooperative principles to their own lives and teach cooperative principles to others.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[This book gives us the unquestionable proof that ethics is a matter of reason. Its fascinating and surprisingly optimistic conclusions are drawn from the results of computer tournaments in which various collaboration algorithms (i.e. strategies) are compared based on their outcomes from the iterative Prisoner's Dilemma problem. Besides igniting the whole field of game theory back in the 80s, the foreword given by Richard Dawkins, as the author of The Selfish Gene, should be more than enough of a recommendation. Its importance is outstanding because it clearly proves, in a scientific fashion, that TIT FOR TAT is the most efficient strategy in non-zero-sum scenarios. So don't be envious, don't be the first to defect, reciprocate both cooperation and defection, and don't be too clever. And read this excellent book.]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[The world-famous masterpiece by Nobel laureate Thomas Mann -- here in a new translation by Michael Henry Heim.<br />Published on the eve of World War I, a decade after Buddenbrooks had established Thomas Mann as a literary celebrity, Death in Venice tells the story of Gustav von Aschenbach, a successful but aging writer who follows his wanderlust to Venice in search of spiritual fulfillment that instead leads to his erotic doom.<br />In the decaying city, besieged by an unnamed epidemic, he becomes obsessed with an exquisite Polish boy, Tadzio. "It is a story of the voluptuousness of doom," Mann wrote. "But the problem I had especially in mind was that of the artist's dignity."]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[– Care este diferența dintre filosofie și rock`n`roll? Nici una, ar putea răspunde Alain de Botton, atâta vreme cât ambele sunt un mod de viață.<br /><br />– Formula matematică a aventurii romantice: în ea intră, pe lângă filosofie și rock`n`roll, economia de piață, revistele pentru femei, curentele de modă și nici un pic de imprevizibil.<br /><br />– O carte despre dragoste în extraordinara ei banalitate.<br /><br />– O diagramă a inimii și a minții îndrăgostite.<br /><br />– Alain de Botton pune întrebări despre sex, cumpărături, romane, tipologia sărutului, gelozie, iar Flaubert, Descartes, Platon, D.H. Lawrence sau Aretha Franklin răspund printre rânduri.<br /><br />– Un mic manual de filosofie a vieții de zi cu zi.<br /><br />– O fotografie de grup a câtorva romantici de secol XXI, în care apar și autorul, și cititorul.<br /><br />– Sex, shopping și un roman (Mișcarea romantică) a fost tradusă în 14 limbi.<br /><br /><br />Traducere din engleză de Oana Cristescu<br /><br />(sursa: <a target="_blank" href="http://www.humanitas.ro/humanitas/sex-shopping-si-un-roman" rel="nofollow">http://www.humanitas.ro/humanitas/sex...</a>)]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[After an interval of some months or years, and at Phlius, a town of Peloponnesus, the tale of the last hours of Socrates is narrated to Echecrates and other Phliasians by Phaedo the 'beloved disciple.' The Dialogue necessarily takes the form of a narrative, because Socrates has to be described acting as well as speaking. The minutest particulars of the event are interesting to distant friends, and the narrator has an equal interest in them. During the voyage of the sacred ship to and from Delos, which has occupied thirty days, the execution of Socrates has been deferred. (Compare Xen. Mem.) The time has been passed by him in conversation with a select company of disciples. But now the holy season is over, and the disciples meet earlier than usual in order that they may converse with Socrates for the last time. Those who were present, and those who might have been expected to be present, are mentioned by name.]]></book_description>

    <b>A loosely formed autobiography by Andy Warhol, told with his trademark blend of irony and detachment</b>
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>In <i>The Philosophy of Andy Warhol</i>—which, with the subtitle "(From A to B and Back Again)," is less a memoir than a collection of riffs and reflections—he talks about love, sex, food, beauty, fame, work, money, and success; about New York, America, and his childhood in McKeesport, Pennsylvania; about his good times and bad in New York, the explosion of his career in the sixties, and his life among celebrities.</p>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In the ten years since its publication in 1988, Stephen Hawking's classic work has become a landmark volume in scientific writing, with more than nine million copies in forty languages sold worldwide. That edition was on the cutting edge of what was then known about the origins and nature of the universe. But the intervening years have seen extraordinary advances in the technology of observing both the micro- and the macrocosmic worlds. These observations have confirmed many of Professor Hawking's theoretical predictions in the first edition of his book, including the recent discoveries of the Cosmic Background Explorer satellite (COBE), which probed back in time to within 300,000 years of the universe's beginning and revealed wrinkles in the fabric of space-time that he had projected. Eager to bring to his original text the new knowledge revealed by these observations, as well as his own recent research, Professor Hawking has prepared a new introduction to the book, written an entirely new chapter on wormholes and time travel, and updated the chapters throughout.]]></book_description>

    <book_description><![CDATA[Here at last is a coherent, unintimidating introduction to the challenging and fascinating landscape of Western philosophy. Written expressly for "anyone who believes there are big questions out there, but does not know how to approach them," Think provides a sound framework for exploring the most basic themes of philosophy, and for understanding how major philosophers have tackled the questions that have pressed themselves most forcefully on human consciousness.]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[A challenging walkthrough of the major themes of philosophy passing by Descartes, Locke, Leibniz, Hume, Kant and few others. It surely requires a lot of thinking to understand all the arguments put forward like, for example, why body-soul dualism implies the possibility of zombies and mutants, why (even hard) determinism doesn't justify fatalism, or why religious belief couldn't be grounded in reason. But I wouldn't say this book is an introduction to philosophy because first, it's quite heavy, and second, it barely mentions the ancient Greeks who actually introduced us to philosophy. Very good read nonetheless.]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[This well-researched examination of human moral impulses will appeal to liberals and conservatives alike following the 2016 presidential campaign and election. <br /><br />As America descends deeper into polarization and paralysis, social psychologist Jonathan Haidt has done the seemingly impossible—challenged conventional thinking about morality, politics, and religion in a way that speaks to everyone on the political spectrum. Drawing on his twenty five years of groundbreaking research on moral psychology, he shows how moral judgments arise not from reason but from gut feelings. He shows why liberals, conservatives, and libertarians have such different intuitions about right and wrong, and he shows why each side is actually right about many of its central concerns. In this subtle yet accessible book, Haidt gives you the key to understanding the miracle of human cooperation, as well as the curse of our eternal divisions and conflicts. If you’re ready to trade in anger for understanding, read The Righteous Mind.<br /><br />A groundbreaking investigation into the origins of morality, which turns out to be the basis for religion and politics. The book is timely (explaining the American culture wars and refuting the "New Atheists"), scholarly (integrating insights from many fields) and great fun to read (like Haidt's last book, <i>The Happiness Hypothesis</i>).]]></book_description>

    <user_review><![CDATA[In which the author puts his intuition above his reason, and tells us that we should do the same since we can't help it anyway, unless we're psychopaths like autistic or so.<br /><br />The analogy of the individual as a single neuron versus society as the whole brain is such a silly argument in itself that it triggered each of my neurons to laugh out loud. The other analogy of moral judgements as taste buds clearly shows that the author gave up reason in dealing with morality, asserting it's just a matter of taste. Moreover, if the moral instinct is an elephant and the reason is a rider that cannot stir the elephant either way, why calling it a rider? If the only purpose of reason is to help improving the reputation, it seems to me that a more suitable analogy would have been the moral instinct as a peacock and the reason as its tail.<br /><br />This is such a flawed book not because its premise is bad, because it isn't, we are indeed primarily instinctive animals and secondly rational humans, but because it understates the usefulness of reason. I think that an individual can thrive either by being friendly and sociable, the Dale Carnegie way, and reason can help with that indeed as the author points out, or just by being smart, the Socrates way, so that even proving everyone else stupid, by using reason, would not hurt its reputation if the arguments are strong. Reasonable individuals have many other uses for society than just being sociable. There's a plethora of notorious smart jerks like Bentham that have given us so much more than any loyal obedient and pious personality you can think of. Agreeing with Hume who stated that the reason is a slave of passions doesn't imply a general theory of the righteous mind, because some of us have a passion for reason.<br /><br />The thesis of this book could be stated in utilitarian terms like this: it is better to be a sociable fool than an individualistic Socrates, because we can't help being fools anyway. But that's saying too much about it, tackling moral philosophy from the mere psychological standpoint cannot get you any futher than "let's agree to disagree".]]></user_review>

    <book_description><![CDATA[In this deeply informed and absorbing exchange, Sam Harris and Maajid Nawaz present an antidote to the polarizing rhetoric and obscurantism that have become defining features of our time: honest dialogue. A renowned critic of religion, Harris finds the doctrines of Islam dangerous and irredeemable. No, the Muslim anti-extremist Nawaz argues, Islam is amenable to reform and can find its place in a secular world. Rather than devolve into bigotry or caricature, their exchange presents an inspiring example of courteous attention, sharp-edged wisdom, and finally hope.<br /><br />A former member of the Islamist revolutionary group Hizb ut-Tahrir, author of Radical, and cofounder of the anti-extremist think tank Quilliam, Nawaz speaks with unique authority about the possibility of Islamic reform. Since the 2004 publication of The End of Faith, Harris has critiqued religion and asserted that reason and science are the true guardians of our deepest human values. Islam and the Future of Tolerance is an exemplar of how the fog can lift when hyperbole and posturing are put aside in pursuit of understanding.<br /><br />Guided by a mutual commitment to the belief that no idea is above scrutiny and no people beneath dignity, Harris and Nawaz challenge each other, and consequently their readers, to defend incompatible positions, define and explore their facts, and discover common ground. Published with the explicit hope to inspire many more such conversations, this dialogue extends an invitation to a world riven by violence to take up the task of engagement.]]></book_description>
